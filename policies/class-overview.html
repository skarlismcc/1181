    <h1>Class Overview</h1>

    <p>The full syllabus, which includes class meeting times, office hours, and my contact information, can be found on Canvas.</p>

    <h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>In ENGL 1181, students learn to think rhetorically and develop transferable writing skills. Students read, analyze, and write in a variety of genres, including multimodal texts, and make appropriate rhetorical choices for the audience, purpose, and genre. Additionally, students learn to develop and organize their ideas, revise their work based on feedback, and reflect on their writing process.</p>
    <p>ENGL 1181 was formerly known as ENGL 1180. Students who have completed ENGL 1180 or ENGL 1210 successfully should NOT take ENGL 1181. Students will NOT receive credit for both.</p>

    <h3>What to expect...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Show up! If you miss a lot of classes, you will likely fall behind.</li>
      <li>But... please, don’t attend class if you are sick. Missing one or two glasses won’t be catastrophic. Show up when you are healthy and able, and it won’t be as difficult if you need to miss a couple of classes if something happens (illness or otherwise).</li>
      <li>Be on time. Much of the course content will be presented at the beginning of class to allow for workshop and writing time in class.</li>
      <li>There will be lots of writing. It’s a writing class.</li>
      <li>There will be in-class writing assignments, along with the major projects. We will often work in groups during class to work on writing concepts. Active participation is crucial to your success in this class.</li>
      <li>Be polite and respectful to your peers. You will need to share much of your writing, so it’s important that this is a safe environment for sharing writing and ideas.</li>
      <li>If you need to meet, I have office hours and an email address (found on the first page of the syllabus on Canvas).</li>
      <li>Check your Canvas Inbox regularly for any updates and important information for this class.</li>
      <li>Familiarize yourself with the location of computer labs on campus, the library, and other student resources.</li>
    </ul>
