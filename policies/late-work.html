    <h1>Late Work</h1>

    <p>In this class, I know that life happens — schedules shift, things come up, and unexpected events can get in the way. At the same time, the work in this course builds from week to week, so staying on track is important for your learning. The late-work policies are designed to balance both: flexibility when you need it and enough structure to help you keep from falling behind.</p>
    
    <div class="glance-accent-box">
  <h2>At a Glance</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Up to 24 hours late: Grace period; no penalty; no need to let me know.</li>
    <li>Up to 7 days late: No penalty; leave a Canvas comment.</li>
    <li>Over 7 days late: Extensions only for extenuating circumstances; meeting required.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style=" margin-bottom: -.1em;"><i>Read the full policy information below for assignment exceptions. </i></p>
</div>

    <!-- Grace Period -->
    <h2>Up to 1 day late: Grace Period</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You may submit any assignment (except the Project 2 and the Final Portfolio) up to 24 hours late without penalty and without any additional requirements. This grace period is provided to account for unexpected events.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Extension Check-In -->
    <h2>Up to 7 days late: Extension Check-in</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You may turn in any assignment (except Project 2 and the Final Portfolio) up to 7 days late without a penalty as long as you let me know you are taking an extension.</li>
      <li>To take a late extension, first go to our Canvas class and then:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to Grades and click on the assignment name.</li>
        <li>Then leave a comment letting me know you are taking an extension and press save.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>If it has not been submitted after 7 days past the due date, you will receive no credit.</li>
      <li>I strongly recommend that you create a reminder in your phone or planner for yourself if you take a late extension.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Over 7 Days Late -->
    <h2>Over 7 days late</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Assignments cannot be submitted more than 7 days late unless there are extenuating circumstances. If you foresee needing an extension beyond this period, you must contact me within the first 7 days to arrange a meeting. The meeting doesn't have to occur within that week, but you must reach out as soon as you know there's an issue. We can meet in person or on Teams to discuss your situation and develop a plan to stay on track during this time.</li>
    </ul>
