    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <!-- BOOK -->
    <h3 id="book">Does this class have a book?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Yes, this class uses a free online textbook that has been compiled by Macomb's English department.</li>
      <li>The textbook can be accessed at this link:
        <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/1181a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Navigating Rhetoric and Genre in First-Year Writing</a>.
      </li>
      <li>If you prefer a print or offline version of the readings, you can download the PDF version on Canvas or purchase a copy at the bookstore (starting Winter 2025).</li>
      <li><strong>Note:</strong> Videos, several articles on Visual Rhetoric, and the supplemental readings and videos still need to be accessed through the online textbook.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- MEET -->
    <h3 id="meet">When does this class meet?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The class meeting information can be found on your schedule in
        <a href="https://selfservice.macomb.edu/student" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self-Service</a>
        and on the syllabus. To view the syllabus in Canvas, click on the “Syllabus” link on the left navigation bar.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- MATERIALS -->
    <h3 id="materials">Where do I find our class materials and assignments?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All readings can be found in the online textbook.</li>
      <li>All other materials, resources, and assignments for this class will be found on this website.</li>
      <li>The assignments are also available on Canvas on the Assignments page.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- WEEKLY -->
    <h3 id="weekly">How do I know what I need to do each week?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Everything that you will need to complete and the due dates (readings and assignments) will be listed on the schedule in the syllabus and on the class calendar on this class website.</li>
      <li>You can also find the due dates for the assignments on Canvas. However, there will be additional due dates that will not show up in Canvas, such as readings and some in-class due dates.</li>
      <li>We will also go over upcoming work at the start of every class period.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- SUCCEED -->
    <h3 id="succeed">What can I do to help myself succeed in this class?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Show up to class. Missing one or two classes out of the entire semester might not be catastrophic, but if you find yourself skipping frequently, you will likely do poorly or possibly even fail the class.</li>
      <li>Show up on time. The majority of the content for this class and the explanation of the assignments will be done within the first 30–40 minutes of class. The latter part of class will often be used for workshopping and active learning activities. If you regularly come to class late, you will likely find yourself lost and missing important information.</li>
      <li>Complete all the readings. I do not assign a lot of mandatory reading, so the reading that is assigned will have important concepts, without which you will likely fall behind.</li>
      <li>Give yourself enough time to draft your papers and finish your assignments. Some of the assignments may be able to be completed quickly, such as the weekly essays during the early part of the ethnography. However, many will take a significant amount of time. It’s essential that you give yourself enough time to complete the work in this class.</li>
      <li>Make appointments with the Academic Success Center (formerly Reading and Writing Studios) to get additional help. You can make an appointment through the
        <a href="https://web.penjiapp.com/schools/macomb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Penji website</a> or Penji app.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- CANVAS ISSUES -->
    <h3 id="canvas-issues">What do I do if I can't get into Canvas or am having technical issues with Canvas?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Call Macomb’s Canvas support at <a href="tel:18773622662">877-362-2662</a>.</li>
      <li>I don’t have access to your account, so if something isn’t working right or you are having technical difficulties with the site, you’ll need to contact Macomb’s Canvas support number above.</li>
      <li>If you have any further questions, don’t hesitate to email me. My email address can be found on the syllabus or in the
        <a href="https://www.macomb.edu/contact-us/faculty/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">faculty directory</a> (if you search for my name).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- HYBRID SECTIONS -->
    <h2 id="hybrid">For Hybrid Sections</h2>
    <p>If you have enrolled in a hybrid section of ENGL 1181:</p>
    <p><i>Note: Hybrid classes are listed with an “H” in the section number. For example: ENGL 1181 H1604.</i></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A hybrid class is a mix of online (asynchronous) instruction and in-person, traditional instruction.</li>
      <li>This class is a 50-50 hybrid, meaning that we will meet for 50% of the class hours in person and the other half of the class will be completed online (asynchronously).</li>
      <li>To be successful in this class, you must attend in-person classes and complete the online work assigned for this class. In-person classes are required and will not be recorded or live-streamed.</li>
      <li>Some absences are allowed, just like any in-person class, but there is still an attendance policy for this class.</li>
      <li>This class is designed to cover the more complicated topics during class time. Additionally, you will participate in writing workshops and get feedback on your brainstorming and writing during class. You will also have online work to complete each week, such as video lectures, additional readings, and/or quizzes.</li>
      <li>If you are unable to attend the in-person part of this class, I recommend that you switch to a fully online section. You can add/drop classes during the first week of classes. If you need help with adding or changing classes, reach out to an advisor.</li>
