    <h1>Grading Policies &amp; Info</h1>
    <p>This class will focus on writing as a process, including multiple revisions before your Final Portfolio. Therefore, up until the Final Portfolio, all assignments (except for the quizzes) will be graded on a check system, with the focus on completing all required parts of the assignment.</p>

    <p>I want you to focus on doing the work, not on worrying about your grade. So, if you complete the requirements and turn in all the required parts of the assignment, you will get full credit. Missing requirements will lead to partial credit, or if several requirements are missed, no credit.</p>

    <!-- Incomplete Policy -->
    <h3 id="incomplete">Incomplete Grade Policy</h3>

    <p>An Incomplete (I) grade may be granted only in exceptional circumstances and is not guaranteed. In this course, an Incomplete is reserved for students who have been consistently performing well throughout the semester and experience an unexpected, documented emergency near the end of the term that prevents them from submitting the final portfolio.</p>

    <p>To be eligible for an Incomplete:</p>
    <ul class="compact">
      <li>The student must have completed all major assignments leading up to the final portfolio.</li>
      <li>The student must be passing the class at the time of the request.</li>
      <li>The final portfolio must be the only outstanding work remaining in the course.</li>
      <li>The student must contact the instructor as soon as possible to discuss the situation and provide appropriate documentation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If an Incomplete is granted, a written agreement will outline the timeline and requirements for submitting the final portfolio. Failure to meet the agreed-upon deadline may result in a failing grade for the course. </p>
