    <h1>Generative AI (GenAI) Policy</h1>
 <p>In this ENGL&nbsp;1181 course, we will explore Generative AI (GenAI) as it relates to writing studies, including the ethics of GenAI, the possible impact on written communication, potential uses, and potential issues.</p>

    <h2 id="genai-policy">GenAI Policy</h2>
    <p>We will talk about GenAI in ENGL&nbsp;1181 and have nuanced discussions about potential use. In the meantime, for assignments that are not AI-focused, the following policy and recommendations are in place:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Do not use AI to write the assignment for you or do your thinking.</strong> One of the points of college is to help you learn how to think deeply and critically about a range of topics. This can, at times, be frustrating or difficult. But this is the time to struggle through those things in an environment where your livelihood doesn’t yet depend on it. Don’t ruin that opportunity for yourself.</li>
      <li><strong>Do not use AI in a way that removes your writing voice.</strong> You may think it sounds “better” (more professional or academic), but for those of us who read student writing regularly, it’s often uninteresting and redundant to read. I want to hear your writing voice!</li>
      <li><strong>The grading for ENGL&nbsp;1181 is structured</strong> to allow you to take risks and struggle through parts of the writing process. Use these classes as an opportunity to learn in a low-risk environment so that when the stakes get higher in future classes or your eventual career, you have learned what you needed to learn.</li>
      <li><strong>This class does not use secondary research,</strong> so you should not be getting information from GenAI—just as you should not be getting information from the internet on your topics. If you are interested in exploring GenAI as part of the research process, consider taking one of my ENGL&nbsp;1190 classes.</li>
      <li><strong>If you use AI to assist</strong> for any assignment in this class, you must include an <a href="/resources/gen-ai-transparency.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Transparency Statement</a> (sometimes called an AI Statement of Use) at the end of the assignment. See that page for instructions and examples.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Note:</em> GenAI should not be used for any Weekly Writing Assignments unless otherwise specified on the assignment.</p>

    <h2 id="ethics">GenAI Ethics and Considerations</h2>
    <p>Read the following article to learn about some of the ethical considerations for GenAI usage:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://onlineteaching.umich.edu/articles/ethical-considerations-of-using-genai-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethical Considerations of Using GenAI Tools (University of Michigan)</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Additional Considerations</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Loss of learning:</strong> If you use GenAI to do the “thinking” for you, you aren’t working through the concepts and are missing the learning. This might not seem like a big deal for one assignment or one class, but this loss of learning will add up over time. Eventually, you may find yourself in more difficult classes unable to complete the work effectively, or in a workplace lacking the skills to complete your job.</li>
      <li><strong>Quality issues:</strong> Work created by GenAI is often sub-par, particularly with limited human input. It can sound impressive at first glance, but as an advanced form of predictive text, it doesn’t actually reason through complex ideas. It tends toward vague, repetitive language, overstates claims, and can use biased or sales-pitch-like phrasing.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Please trust the process in this class and start with your own ideas and your own writing.</p>

    <h2 id="using-genai">Using GenAI</h2>
    <p>For those interested in exploring GenAI as a part of the writing process, see the <a href="/resources/gen-ai-considerations.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GenAI section of the course website</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="instructor-use">Instructor GenAI Use</h2>
    <p>I may use GenAI to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Help me edit and/or clarify my own writing (e.g., assignment instructions, presentation slides, and/or feedback comments I’ve already written but think might be confusing or unclear).</li>
      <li>Write example text (such as an example paragraph) to help demonstrate course concepts or to use as a starting place for an in-class activity.</li>
      <li>Brainstorm in-class activities and assignments.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>I will never use GenAI to grade your work or generate feedback on your work.</strong> Feedback, assessment, and suggestions will always come from me.</p>
    <p>When I use GenAI to assist with any of the tasks above, I will always carefully check output, revise as necessary, and ensure the accuracy of any course materials.</p>
