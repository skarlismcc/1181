    <h1>Academic Honesty, Plagiarism, &amp; Generative AI Policy</h1>

    <p>Academic honesty is highly valued at Macomb. Your work should show your own ideas and your own words. If you use someone else’s words, ideas, or work—no matter where it came from—you need to say so. That means citing your sources and being clear about exactly what came from you and what came from someone else. This applies to everything: books, websites, videos, conversations, images, and even things shared in public spaces or meetings.</p>

<div class="glance-accent-box">
  <h3>At a Glance</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Do your own work.</li>
    <li>Cite your sources.</li>
    <li>Don’t copy off the internet or GenAI.</li>
    <li>Don’t reuse work without permission.</li>
    <li>Don’t fabricate or misrepresent research.
      <div class="list-para">(This includes inventing sources, quotes, paraphrases, or data.)</div>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

    <p>But also—don’t panic about this. This is a writing class, which means you’ll be learning how to do all this properly, and there will be room for mistakes and opportunities to improve along the way.</p>
    <p>In this class, your writing should be your own. That means doing your own thinking and using your own words.</p>
    <p>More than anything, I want to hear your thoughts and read your writing—even if those thoughts are still forming or your writing feels messy. That’s part of the process! We’ll be focusing on drafting, revising, and developing ideas over time. Grading in this class reflects that process, not perfection or polished grammar. My goal is to help you find and strengthen your writing voice. But I can’t give you useful and meaningful feedback on your writing if the writing isn't yours. </p>
    <p>So, don’t copy someone else’s work, have someone else write your paper, or use AI tools to create full or partial drafts.</p>
    <p>If you’re ever unsure about what’s okay, just ask. I’m here to support you—not to catch you doing something wrong. Still, academic dishonesty is serious and can result in a failing grade on the assignment or in the course.</p>
    <p><b>Bottom line: do your own work, trust the process, and ask for help when you need it. </b></p>



    <h2>Plagiarism &amp; Academic Integrity Policy</h2>
    <p>Serious or unresolved instances of academic dishonesty (including plagiarism or fabrication) may result in a lowered grade, a zero on the assignment with no opportunity for resubmission, or failure in the course, depending on the degree and type of dishonesty. An academic integrity report may also be filed with the college.</p>
    <p>Academic dishonesty may include, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Having someone complete an assignment for you</li>
      <li>Having someone make extensive revisions or rewrites to your paper</li>
      <li>Copying work or ideas from another student</li>
      <li>Copying or purchasing assignments or text from the internet</li>
      <li>Using outside information without proper citation</li>
      <li>Fabricating research—such as inventing sources, quotes, paraphrases, data, or misrepresenting what a source says</li>
      <li>Reusing work from another class without permission</li>
      <li>Using AI in inappropriate or dishonest ways (see Generative AI Policy)</li>
      <li>Using information without attributing it to the source (i.e. failing to cite sources).</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>We’ll go over this more in class, but the basic principle is simple: don’t copy ideas or information from others without crediting where they came from.</p>

       <h2>Secondary Research in ENGL 1181</h2>
    <p>You will not use secondary research in your writing this semester (i.e. articles from the internet, news articles, information from books). The papers and writing assignments in this class will use primary research (such as observations and references to writing samples that you collect online).</p>
    <p>Research writing, including how to research, evaluating sources, and writing about secondary sources, is covered in ENGL 1190.</p>
