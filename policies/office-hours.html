    <h1>Office Hours</h1>

    <p>Office hours are a time that faculty set aside for meeting with students.</p>

    <p>You do not need an appointment for set office hours; you can just drop in to ask questions or get help.</p>

    <p>If you would like help on a particular assignment, please bring the paper/assignment with you or make sure it's in your shared Google Drive folder, so that we can access it during the meeting.</p>

    <p>I will not "pre-grade" any assignments, but if there is a particular concern or an area of a paper that you want extra help with, I'm always happy to sit down with you to look over that together.</p>

<h2><i>Important Notes</i></h2> 
      <ul>
        <li>Office hours are subject to change with notice.</li>
        <li>Spring/Summer semester office hours are by appointment only. I'm typically available for a few minutes before or after class. If you need longer than that, just let me know and we can find a time to meet. </li>
