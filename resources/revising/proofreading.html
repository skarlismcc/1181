    <h1 style="margin-bottom: 0.3em;">Later Order Concerns & Proofreading</h1>

    <p>
      Later Order Concerns (LOCs) cover the proofreading and editing stage of revision. This should be done last after you've already done HOC and MOC revision. Below are some tips for proofreading and a list of common issues. I also recommend having a friend or family member look over your writing at this stage, as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Have you ever read an email or text hours later and found a ridiculous typo or error that you made?
    </p>

    <p>
      Sometimes it can be hard for us to see our own typos because our brains want to "auto-correct" the writing. When we write something, we know what we meant to write. If we don't take a break from our paper and give it time to sit, we often won't be able to see the mistake ourselves. This is especially hard in an 8-week class because there isn't enough time to really take a break from our writing.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are several things we can do to combat that problem in the tips below.

    <h2 id="grammarly">Grammarly</h2>

    <p>
      One of the easiest things you can do to help you proofread is to download the Grammarly add-in for Word or your browser (or both!). They even have one for mobile devices if you find yourself working on your phone often.
    </p>

    <p>
      It will check both your spelling and your grammar for you. It's not always 100% accurate since it's software and not a person, so it's still important to understand basic grammar and mechanics rules, but, oh, does it help! It will catch both spelling and grammar errors far better than Microsoft or Google's built-in software.
    </p>

    <p>
      Grammarly cannot, however, catch more complicated issues like flow and readability. So, you'll still need to read through your paper carefully and use some other techniques. See the
      "<a href="https://online.macomb.edu/courses/40650/pages/grammarly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grammarly</a>" page for more links to install the plug-ins.

    </p>

  <h3>Before You Proofread</h3>
  <p>Good proofreading starts before you even look at the page. Give yourself time and space to come back to your writing with a clear head.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Take a break between writing and proofreading—overnight is ideal, but even 20 minutes helps.</li>
    <li>Choose a time of day when you’re most alert and able to notice small errors.</li>
    <li>Review your older papers to identify your most common mistakes and make a short list of patterns to watch for.</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Core Proofreading Strategies</h3>
  <p>These strategies help you slow down and separate proofreading from reading for meaning.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Read backwards.</strong> Start at the end and move paragraph by paragraph—or line by line—toward the beginning. This helps you focus on surface-level issues instead of the paper’s meaning.</li>
    <li><strong>Use a ruler or sheet of paper.</strong> Covering lines helps your eyes focus on smaller chunks of text.</li>
    <li><strong>Read aloud.</strong> Hearing your writing makes it easier to notice confusing spots, missing words, and awkward phrasing.</li>
    <li><strong>Ask someone else to read it.</strong> Another reader can point out unclear sentences, wordiness, and errors you might miss.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Focus on Specific Issues</h3>
  <p>Instead of trying to catch everything at once, proofread in rounds. Each pass should focus on one type of issue.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Check for your most frequent error first (for example, comma use). Then repeat the process for the next issue.</li>
    <li>Read through the paper several times—once for spelling, once for punctuation, once for clarity, and so on.</li>
    <li><strong>Use spell-check carefully.</strong> Spell-checkers miss homophones (<em>there</em> / <em>their</em> / <em>they’re</em>) and may suggest incorrect replacements.</li>
    <li>If you’re unsure about punctuation or word choice (like <em>affect</em> vs. <em>effect</em>), look it up or use a grammar check tool.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Polishing and Final Checks</h3>
  <p>Proofreading isn’t only about fixing mistakes—it’s also about making your writing clearer and smoother.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Look for overly long sentences that may be harder to follow.</li>
    <li>Vary your sentence lengths and rhythms so the writing flows naturally.</li>
    <li>Cut unnecessary phrases or repetition.</li>
    <li>Pay attention to awkward transitions or confusing spots and revise for clarity.</li>
  </ul>
