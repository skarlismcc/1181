      <h2>Paragraphs</h2>

      <h3>What this handout is about</h3>
      <p>This handout will help you understand how paragraphs are formed, how to develop stronger paragraphs, and how to completely and clearly express your ideas.</p>

      <h3>What is a paragraph?</h3>
      <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph.</p>
      <p>For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.</p>

      <h3>How do I decide what to put in a paragraph?</h3>
      <p>Before you can begin to determine what the composition of a particular paragraph will be, you must first decide on an <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/argument/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">argument</a> and a working <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/thesis-statements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thesis statement</a> for your paper. What is the most important idea that you are trying to convey to your reader? The information in each paragraph must be related to that idea.</p>
      <p>In other words, your paragraphs should remind your reader that there is a recurrent relationship between your thesis and the information in each paragraph. A working thesis functions like a seed from which your paper, and your ideas, will grow. The whole process is an organic one—a natural progression from a seed to a full-blown paper where there are direct, familial relationships between all of the ideas in the paper.</p>
      <p>The decision about what to put into your paragraphs begins with the germination of a seed of ideas; this “germination process” is better known as <a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/brainstorming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brainstorming</a>. There are many techniques for brainstorming; whichever one you choose, this stage of paragraph development cannot be skipped. Building paragraphs can be like building a skyscraper: there must be a well-planned foundation that supports what you are building.</p>
      <p>Any cracks, inconsistencies, or other corruptions of the foundation can cause your whole paper to crumble.</p>
      <p>So, let’s suppose that you have done some brainstorming to develop your thesis. What else should you keep in mind as you begin to create paragraphs? Every paragraph in a paper should be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unified:</strong> All of the sentences in a single paragraph should be related to a single controlling idea (often expressed in the topic sentence of the paragraph).</li>
        <li><strong>Clearly related to the thesis:</strong> The sentences should all refer to the central idea, or thesis, of the paper (Rosen and Behrens 119).</li>
        <li><strong>Coherent:</strong> The sentences should be arranged in a logical manner and should follow a definite plan for development (Rosen and Behrens 119).</li>
        <li><strong>Well-developed:</strong> Every idea discussed in the paragraph should be adequately explained and supported through evidence and details that work together to explain the paragraph’s controlling idea (Rosen and Behrens 119).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How do I organize a paragraph?</h3>
      <p>There are many different ways to organize a paragraph. The organization you choose will depend on the controlling idea of the paragraph. Below are a few possibilities for organization, with links to brief examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Narration:</strong> Tell a story. Go chronologically, from start to finish. (<a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/paragraphs/#:~:text=See%20an%20example.-,Narration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See an example.</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong> Provide specific details about what something looks, smells, tastes, sounds, or feels like. Organize spatially, in order of appearance, or by topic. (<a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/paragraphs/#:~:text=See%20an%20example.-,Description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See an example.</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Process:</strong> Explain how something works, step by step. Perhaps follow a sequence—first, second, third. (<a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/paragraphs/#:~:text=See%20an%20example.-,Process" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See an example.</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Separate into groups or explain the various parts of a topic. (<a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/paragraphs/#:~:text=See%20an%20example.-,Classification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">See an example.</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Illustration:</strong> Give examples and explain how those examples support your point. (See an example in the 5-step process below.)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Illustration paragraph: a 5-step example</h3>
      <p>From the list above, let’s choose “illustration” as our rhetorical purpose. We’ll walk through a 5-step process for building a paragraph that illustrates a point in an argument. For each step there is an explanation and example. Our example paragraph will be about human misconceptions of piranhas.</p>

      <h4>Step 1. Decide on a controlling idea and create a topic sentence</h4>
      <p>Paragraph development begins with the formulation of the controlling idea. This idea directs the paragraph’s development. Often, the controlling idea of a paragraph will appear in the form of a topic sentence. In some cases, you may need more than one sentence to express a paragraph’s controlling idea.</p>
      <p><strong>Controlling idea and topic sentence</strong> — Despite the fact that piranhas are relatively harmless, many people continue to believe the pervasive myth that piranhas are dangerous to humans.</p>

      <h4>Step 2. Elaborate on the controlling idea</h4>
      <p>Paragraph development continues with an elaboration on the controlling idea, perhaps with an explanation, implication, or statement about significance. Our example offers a possible explanation for the pervasiveness of the myth.</p>
      <p><strong>Elaboration</strong> — This impression of piranhas is exacerbated by their mischaracterization in popular media.</p>

      <h4>Step 3. Give an example (or multiple examples)</h4>
      <p>Paragraph development progresses with an example (or more) that illustrates the claims made in the previous sentences.</p>
      <p><strong>Example</strong> — For example, the promotional poster for the 1978 horror film <em>Piranha</em> features an oversized piranha poised to bite the leg of an unsuspecting woman.</p>

      <h4>Step 4. Explain the example(s)</h4>
      <p>The next movement in paragraph development is an explanation of each example and its relevance to the topic sentence. The explanation should demonstrate the value of the example as evidence to support the major claim, or focus, in your paragraph.</p>
      <p>Continue the pattern of giving examples and explaining them until all points/examples that the writer deems necessary have been made and explained. NONE of your examples should be left unexplained. You might be able to explain the relationship between the example and the topic sentence in the same sentence which introduced the example. More often, however, you will need to explain that relationship in a separate sentence.</p>
      <p><strong>Explanation for example</strong> — Such a terrifying representation easily captures the imagination and promotes unnecessary fear.</p>
      <p>Notice that the example and explanation steps of this 5-step process (steps 3 and 4) can be repeated as needed. The idea is that you continue to use this pattern until you have completely developed the main idea of the paragraph.</p>

      <h4>Step 5. Complete the paragraph’s idea or transition into the next paragraph</h4>
      <p>The final movement in paragraph development involves tying up the loose ends of the paragraph. At this point, you can remind your reader about the relevance of the information to the larger paper, or you can make a concluding point for this example. You might, however, simply transition to the next paragraph.</p>
      <p><strong>Sentences for completing a paragraph</strong> — While the trope of the man-eating piranhas lends excitement to the adventure stories, it bears little resemblance to the real-life piranha. By paying more attention to fact than fiction, humans may finally be able to let go of this inaccurate belief.</p>

      <h4>Finished paragraph</h4>
      <p>Despite the fact that piranhas are relatively harmless, many people continue to believe the pervasive myth that piranhas are dangerous to humans. This impression of piranhas is exacerbated by their mischaracterization in popular media. For example, the promotional poster for the 1978 horror film <em>Piranha</em> features an oversized piranha poised to bite the leg of an unsuspecting woman. Such a terrifying representation easily captures the imagination and promotes unnecessary fear. While the trope of the man-eating piranhas lends excitement to the adventure stories, it bears little resemblance to the real-life piranha. By paying more attention to fact than fiction, humans may finally be able to let go of this inaccurate belief.</p>

    <!-- Transitions Handout -->
    <section id="transitions-handout">
      <h2>Transitions</h2>

      <h3>What this handout is about</h3>
      <p>In this crazy, mixed-up world of ours, transitions glue our ideas and our essays together. This handout will introduce you to some useful transitional expressions and help you employ them effectively.</p>

      <h3>The function and importance of transitions</h3>
      <p>In both academic writing and professional writing, your goal is to convey information clearly and concisely, if not to convert the reader to your way of thinking. Transitions help you to achieve these goals by establishing logical connections between sentences, paragraphs, and sections of your papers. In other words, transitions tell readers what to do with the information you present to them.</p>
      <p>Whether single words, quick phrases, or full sentences, they function as signs that tell readers how to think about, organize, and react to old and new ideas as they read through what you have written.</p>
      <p>Transitions signal relationships between ideas—relationships such as: “Another example coming up—stay alert!” or “Here’s an exception to my previous statement” or “Although this idea appears to be true, here’s the real story.” Basically, transitions provide the reader with directions for how to piece together your ideas into a logically coherent argument. Transitions are not just verbal decorations that embellish your paper by making it sound or read better. They are words with particular meanings that tell the reader to think and react in a particular way to your ideas. In providing the reader with these important cues, transitions help readers understand the logic of how your ideas fit together.</p>

      <h3>Signs that you might need to work on your transitions</h3>
      <p>How can you tell whether you need to work on your transitions? Here are some possible clues:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your instructor has written comments like “choppy,” “jumpy,” “abrupt,” “flow,” “need signposts,” or “how is this related?” on your papers.</li>
        <li>Your readers (instructors, friends, or classmates) tell you that they had trouble following your organization or train of thought.</li>
        <li>You tend to write the way you think—and your brain often jumps from one idea to another pretty quickly.</li>
        <li>You wrote your paper in several discrete “chunks” and then pasted them together.</li>
        <li>You are working on a group paper; the draft you are working on was created by pasting pieces of several people’s writing together.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Organization</h3>
      <p>Since the clarity and effectiveness of your transitions will depend greatly on how well you have organized your paper, you may want to evaluate your paper’s organization before you work on transitions. In the margins of your draft, summarize in a word or short phrase what each paragraph is about or how it fits into your analysis as a whole. This exercise should help you to see the order of and connection between your ideas more clearly.</p>
      <p>If after doing this exercise you find that you still have difficulty linking your ideas together in a coherent fashion, your problem may be not with transitions but with organization. For help in this area (and a more thorough explanation of the “reverse outlining” technique described in the previous paragraph), please see the Writing Center handout on organization.</p>

      <h3>How transitions work</h3>
      <p>The organization of your written work includes two elements: (1) the order in which you have chosen to present the different parts of your discussion or argument, and (2) the relationships you construct between these parts. Transitions cannot substitute for good organization, but they can make your organization clearer and easier to follow. Take a look at the following example:</p>
      <p>readers. The Republicans are very organized.</p>
      <p>This is a recipe for confusion, and the reader’s comprehension will suffer. Adding a transition or two helps:</p>
      <p>paragraph, or the one you are about to begin?</p>

      <h3>Transitions between sections</h3>
      <p>In longer pieces of writing, you may need to include transitional paragraphs that summarize for the reader the information just covered and specify the relevance of this information to the discussion in the following section.</p>

      <h3>Transitions between paragraphs</h3>
      <p>If you have done a good job of arranging paragraphs so that the content of one leads logically to the next, the transition will highlight a relationship that already exists by summarizing the previous paragraph and suggesting something of the content of the paragraph that follows. A transition between paragraphs can be a word or two (however, for example, similarly), a phrase, or a sentence. Transitions can be at the end of the first paragraph, at the beginning of the second paragraph, or in both places.</p>

      <h3>Transitions within paragraphs</h3>
      <p>As with transitions between sections and paragraphs, transitions within paragraphs act as cues by helping readers to anticipate what is coming before they read it. Within paragraphs, transitions tend to be single words or short phrases.</p>

      <h3>Transitional expressions</h3>
      <p>Effectively constructing each transition often depends upon your ability to identify words or phrases that will indicate for the reader the kind of logical relationships you want to convey. The table below should make it easier for you to find these words or phrases. Whenever you have trouble finding a word, phrase, or sentence to serve as an effective transition, refer to the information in the table for assistance.</p>
      <p>Look in the left column of the table for the kind of logical relationship you are trying to express. Then look in the right column of the table for examples of words or phrases that express this logical relationship. (Editor note: this has been reformatted for this website, the first column information is in the main bullets below, the second column information is in the sub-bullet that follows.)</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that each of these words or phrases may have a slightly different meaning. Consult a dictionary or writer’s handbook if you are unsure of the exact meaning of a word or phrase.</p>
      <p>The following examples show the logical relationship in the first bullet and the transitional expression in the sub-bullet.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Similarity
          <ul>
            <li>also, in the same way, just as … so too, likewise, similarly</li>
