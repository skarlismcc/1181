    <h1>Brainstorming</h1>

    <p>If you use GenAI for any sort of brainstorming (and I suggest caution here), have it make you <strong>large lists of ideas</strong> that you can choose from.</p>

    <p>If you use GenAI to create a lot of ideas, it can help get some ideas going while still allowing you to think through the suggestions and make the best choices.</p>

    <p>Whereas, if you have GenAI generate just <strong>one idea</strong> and stick with it, that idea might:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Not work well for the assignment, and</li>
      <li>Not be an idea that you feel like you can write about.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you don’t understand the idea enough to write about it, you’ll be more likely to want AI to help you with the next step and the next. </p>
