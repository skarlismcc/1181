    <h1>Citing Your Sources</h1>

    <h2>What do I need to cite?</h2>
    <p>Any information or ideas that you get from outside sources (i.e. that are not your own), such as...</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Primary research</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Including quotes from writing that you are analyzing, references to videos online, interviews, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Secondary research</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Including ideas from newspapers, magazines, online articles, books, and GenAI</li>
          <li><strong>You will not be using secondary research in this class,</strong> but I’m including this information so that you are aware for your other classes.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How do I cite outside sources?</h2>
    <p>Cite information or ideas from outside sources by including the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An in-text citation in the sentence or at the end of the sentence in which the information was used. (For handouts, this can be at the end of a graphic or section of information.)</li>
      <li>A reference page at the end of the document/assignment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our class will be using MLA Citations. See the <a href="/resources/mla-formatting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MLA Formatting &amp; Citations</a> page for more information and example citations.</p>

    <h2>Citations and Weekly Writing Assignments</h2>
    <p>For the Weekly Writing Assignments that discuss one of the readings, you do not need to include a reference page or formal citations when referring to the assigned reading for that week.</p>
    <p>For example, if the assignment asks you to discuss the reading “Navigating Genres” by Kerry&nbsp;Dirk, I already know which text you are using. Instead, make it clear through your writing when you are referring to the reading.</p>

    <p><strong>Example sentence:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      In “Navigating Genres,” Dirk explains that...
    </blockquote>
    <p>In the above example, it’s clear that you are referring to the text, so an additional citation is not necessary for that assignment.</p>

    <h2>Additional Resources and Policies</h2>
