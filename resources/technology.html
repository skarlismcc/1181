    <h1>Technology &amp; Tech Support @ Macomb</h1>

    <h2>Purchase &amp; Loaner Program</h2>
    <p>To purchase a laptop or tablet, you can either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Purchase on your own, or</li>
      <li>Purchase through the bookstore.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Students receiving financial aid can use financial aid to purchase course materials and necessary supplies (including laptops).</p>

    <p>If you are unable to purchase a laptop and you need a computer while being a student at Macomb Community College, you can request one through the Student Laptop Loaner Program. You will need to return this laptop to the SOS office once your classes are completed.</p>

    <p>For questions regarding the laptop request please contact the SOS office at <a href="tel:5864478609">586-447-8609</a>.</p>

    <p>To request a loaner laptop, visit the link below:</p>

    <h2>Purchase Options &amp; Considerations</h2>
    <p>For our class, a tablet, laptop, or Chromebook will all work. However, consider your major and what you might need down the road before purchasing anything.</p>

    <h3>Laptop (Windows or Mac)</h3>
    <p>A standard laptop will likely run any software you might need during college.</p>
    <p>If you are going into a tech-heavy field, such as graphic design, animation, or computer science, you may want to talk to a professor in that department before making a decision.</p>

    <h3>Tablet with Keyboard (iPad or Android)</h3>
    <p>For many of your classes, a tablet with a keyboard will likely be enough. A tablet also can provide a better experience for reading and highlighting online and digital textbooks. However, not all software is available for tablets, and you may find some functionality limited.</p>

    <h3>Chromebook</h3>
    <p>Depending on your major and the software needed, a Chromebook may also work. You will be able to use Office 365 online and Google Docs / Suite online for most of your work. These laptops can also be much less expensive than a standard laptop. However, if you need to install specific software, you might not have that option on a Chromebook.</p>
