    <h1>In-Class Overview</h1>
    <p>This section has resources in-class activities and workshops. </p>
    <p>These resources are meant to be used with planned learning activities and will typically not make sense on their own. (In other words, don't use these to try to figure out what you missed in class. Check with your team and/or the class slides in our shared class folder for that.)</p>
    <p>Use the <b>In-Class</b> navigation menu to get started. </p>
