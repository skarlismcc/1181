    <h1>Different Audiences</h1>
    <p>Write in one genre about one situation for multiple audiences.</p>
    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Your parents/guardians are out of town; you threw a party; police broke it up; you received a noise violation and the house is a mess.</p>
    <p>Write a brief message (email, letter, or text) to each audience:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A friend who wasn’t at the party (can be a longer text message or two)</li>
      <li>Your parent(s)/guardian(s)</li>
      <li>The judge hearing your case</li>
      <li>Your boss (explaining a day off for court)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Discuss how the message changes by audience, then split up who writes what.</p>
