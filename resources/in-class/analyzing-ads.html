    <h1>Analyzing Magazines and Ads</h1>

    <h2>Part 1: Looking at the whole magazine</h2>
    <p>Learn everything you can about the intended audience.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who is the audience?</li>
      <li>How can we tell?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Look at ads, articles, photos—anything that gives clues.</p>

    <h2>Part 2: Analyzing an advertisement</h2>
    <p>Consider: color, images, objects, people, expressions, words, language choice, font choice, mood/tone, symbols, etc. Write each on your paper and explain how it targets the audience.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who is the audience for this ad?</li>
      <li>How can you tell?</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Example (color):</em> “The colors are bright and attention-grabbing with lots of pinks, purples, and blues—skewing feminine/young to match the audience.”</p>
    <p>Be thoughtful and detailed. If there’s time, swap magazines and do this twice. Be prepared to share.</p>
