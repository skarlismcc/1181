    <h1>AI Transparency Statement</h1>

    <p>Since we’ll be exploring Generative AI as a part of this class, please include a brief statement at the end of any assignment where you used AI at any stage of the writing process. <em>Note: GenAI should not be used for any Weekly Writing Assignments unless otherwise specified on the assignment.</em></p>

    <p><em>For Project 1, include a transparency statement regardless of GenAI use. For example, if you did not use GenAI, you should still include a GenAI transparency statement that says as much.</em></p>

    <h2>Format</h2>
    <p>Include the title <strong>"AI Transparency Statement"</strong> or <strong>"AI Statement of Use"</strong>, underlined, and then a short statement of how you used GenAI in that assignment. Also include the specific AI used in your statement. (For Chatbot Arena, include the specific Chatbot tool selected in the drop-down. For example: “ChatGPT 4o” or “Gemini 2.5”)</p>

    <p><strong>Example Formatting:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      <u>AI Transparency Statement</u><br><br>
      AI assistance was used to review sentence clarity and suggest more concise wording. I revised all suggestions myself and made final edits independently.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Some Statement Examples</h2>

    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong><br>
    ChatGPT was used to review sentence clarity and suggest more concise wording. I revised all suggestions myself and made final edits independently.</p>

    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong><br>
    I used ClaudeAI to generate a brief outline of my ideas and to get feedback on paragraph transitions. All writing and analysis are my original work.</p>

    <p><strong>Example 3:</strong><br>
    I used Grammarly Pro to proofread for grammar and clarity. No large sections of text were generated, and all ideas reflect my own thinking.</p>

    <p><strong>Example 4:</strong><br>
    Microsoft Copilot helped me revise awkward phrasing and improve flow for my introduction and several of my paragraphs on pages 3 and 4. I made sure the voice and content stayed true to my original writing.</p>

    <p><strong>Example 5:</strong><br>
    I asked Gemini 2.5 through Chatbot Arena for help identifying unclear sentences and for suggestions to make my introduction stronger. I edited the text myself based on that feedback.</p>

    <h2>Example Statement for No GenAI Use</h2>
    <p>I did not use GenAI in any capacity on this draft.</p>
