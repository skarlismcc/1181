    <h1>Class Reflection: Instructions &amp; Prompts</h1>
    <p>Your class reflection will be a thorough and insightful reflection on your writing in this course.</p>

    <h2 id="genre">Genre</h2>
    <p>You may write or create this in <strong>any* genre of your choosing</strong>, such as a blog article, letter, a podcast, a video, or something else. Many different genres can work as long as the prompts are covered and the topics are covered with insight and detail. <strong>Do not</strong> simply list the prompts to answer; you must choose a genre to write in and create a cohesive reflection.</p>
    <p>You may work in groups or with a partner for this as long as each student addresses the required prompts.</p>
    <p><i>*The only genre you <strong>cannot</strong> choose for this project is an essay, since this project doesn't lend itself to one controlling idea.</i></p>

    <h3>Examples of genres chosen by previous students:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>a podcast (several students worked together on this)</li>
      <li>a radio or video interview (had a friend interview them)</li>
      <li>a formal letter to me</li>
      <li>a blog article to future students</li>
      <li>a website</li>
      <li>an interactive visual website</li>
      <li>a newsletter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This list is not exhaustive; feel free to come up with something different as long as you can thoughtfully cover the prompts!</p>

</div>
    <h3>Some Notes on Specific Genres:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Essay:</strong> This is the only banned genre for this project. Essays need one controlling idea, and there are too many prompts to cover to work.</li>
      <li><strong>PowerPoint presentation:</strong> PowerPoint presentations/Google Slides are meant to be used as visuals to go along with a presentation. If you choose a PowerPoint presentation, you will need to record the presentation along with the slides (i.e. use screen recording software to record you talking while giving the presentation on your screen).</li>
      <li><strong>Video & Audio Genres:</strong> For video or audio based genres, <strong>limit</strong> the length to five minutes per person. If you are working alone, that means your video or podcast should be five minutes or less (roughly). If you are working with others, limit it to five minutes per person (i.e. for three students, the video/podcast shouldn't be longer than 15 minutes). This is to ensure I have enough time at the end of the semester to get through multiple classes' worth of Final Portfolios.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="prompts">Prompts</h2>
    <p>The Class Reflection should address the following prompts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What do you think of yourself as a writer? What are your strengths and weaknesses?</li>
      <li>What did you think about writing at the beginning of the semester? What do you think about college writing now, after this semester?</li>
      <li>How have you grown as a writer? As a student?</li>
      <li>What are the strengths of your final genre analysis essay? The weaknesses? Self-assess your own writing here.</li>
      <li>How (specifically) did you go about revising your final genre analysis for the Class Portfolio? (Be specific about what you revised.) Specifically, discuss at least one HOC or MOC revision (high/middle order concern) and at least one LOC revision (later order concern). Use examples from your own writing to illustrate your points.</li>
      <li>Think back on the time you spent on various assignments for this class and the feedback you received. What would you do differently if you were to do it over? Why? What would you do the same? Why? This could be for a specific assignment or even your whole approach to the class.</li>
      <li>Finally, what advice would you offer to students taking this class next semester?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="requirements">Additional Instructions and Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The responses for each prompt should be well-developed and include specific examples, when appropriate.</li>
      <li>It may help to think of each of these requiring roughly a paragraph of information if written as an essay, so think about what that level of development and detail might look like for your chosen genre.</li>
      <li>There is no length requirement for the class reflection since this can be written in different genres, but make sure the prompts are addressed thoughtfully and thoroughly.</li>
      <li>These do not need to be covered in this order, just make sure they are all addressed.</li>
      <li>You may use AI to help with "clean up" on this project, such as revision suggestions, help with awkward wording, organization, etc. once you have initially drafted the assignment. Since this is a reflection, it's essential that the ideas are yours! Please don't use AI until after you have a first full draft. A detailed AI Statement of Use is required for any GenAI use on this project.</li>
    </ul>
