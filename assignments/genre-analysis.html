    <h1>Genre Analysis Essay</h1>

    <h2>Objective &amp; Assignment Overview</h2>
    <p>For this assignment, you will write a 1300–1700 word (roughly 5–7 page) essay that analyzes one primary genre found in the discourse community you’ve been observing this semester. Your essay should analyze this genre—including its conventions—and explain how it functions within the community: how it helps the community achieve goals, and what it reveals about the community’s values, expectations, and communication practices.</p>

    <h3>Assignment Overview</h3>
    <p>Your task is to select one primary genre in your discourse community and analyze it <em>as a genre</em> and within the context of your community. You will need to find at least three samples of this genre to use as support for your analysis.</p>

    <h4>Examples of Genres</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Posts in a Reddit, Facebook, or forum community</li>
      <li>Video posts in a TikTok community (including the video, captions, tags, etc.)</li>
      <li>Comments on a post in a Facebook group</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> For shorter genres (e.g., Discord messages or short comments), you may need three snippets of back-and-forth conversation instead of three isolated messages.</p>

    <h2>Assignment Prompt</h2>
    <p>Your analysis must briefly introduce your specific online discourse community and then include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A description of the genre</li>
      <li>The purpose and audience (generalized from your samples and observations)</li>
      <li>An analysis of at least three conventions of the chosen genre</li>
      <li>An analysis of how this genre functions within your community</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Additional Information / Breakdown of the Prompt</h3>

    <h4>Required Topics / Analysis</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Introduction of Discourse Community:</strong> Provide a brief overview of the community before introducing the genre you will analyze.</li>
      <li><strong>Genre Description:</strong> Provide an overview/description of the genre and any background information readers need to understand it.
        <div class="list-para">If there are multiple styles or sub-genres, describe the range and then state which one you will focus on. Narrow to one main style for analysis.</div>
        <div class="list-para">For example, if your subreddit includes meme posts, YouTube video links, and text posts asking for advice, summarize all three and then note: “This paper will focus on the text-based posts.”</div>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> What is the purpose of this genre in the community? How does it help address goals or common needs?</li>
      <li><strong>Audience:</strong> Who is the intended audience? Are there expectations about who can read/write/respond?</li>
      <li><strong>Conventions &amp; Rhetorical Features:</strong> Analyze at least three conventions (design/format, tone, language, style, structure, etc.). Explain how these conventions contribute to the genre’s effectiveness in the community.
        <div class="list-para"><em>Tip:</em> Don’t try to cover all three conventions in one paragraph. Break them into multiple, fully developed paragraphs with support.</div>
      </li>
      <li><strong>How the Genre Functions in the Community:</strong> Explain how the genre supports the community’s goals, values, and communication style.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Possible Topics for Discussing How the Genre Functions</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Community Values:</strong> What does the genre reveal about shared values/expectations? How does its use reflect shared goals and culture?</li>
      <li><strong>Broader Implications:</strong> How does this genre connect to other forms of communication in the community? What does this suggest about the role of genres in shaping communication and understanding?</li>
      <li><strong>Context &amp; Circulation:</strong> Where/how does this genre circulate? Formal or informal contexts? Shared digitally or in person? <em>(Not every community will need this.)</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips</h2>

    <h3>Choosing Your Genre</h3>
    <p>Some communities have distinct styles within a genre (e.g., book-review videos vs. book-list videos on BookTok). Choose <em>one</em> style to analyze. You can mention the other styles later when discussing how the genre functions in your community, but keep the analysis focused on a single style.</p>

    <h3>Analyzing the Conventions</h3>
    <p>If “conventions” feels abstract, mentally substitute “informal rules.” Ask: what are the informal rules of this genre? If you had to produce this genre yourself, what would you do to make it fit the community and genre?</p>
    <p>Example for lecture slides as a genre:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Large headers at the top of each slide; smaller but readable body text.</li>
      <li>Information organized into lists more often than paragraphs.</li>
      <li>Design elements (color, graphics, font choices) used to visually tie the presentation together.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For each convention, support with evidence from real samples and discuss why the choice likely became a convention.</p>

    <h3>Supporting Your Claims &amp; Using Evidence</h3>
    <p>Support claims with evidence from your samples and observations. For convention paragraphs, include more than one example to show a trend.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Quotes</strong> work best for short text-based conventions (e.g., what captions include).</li>
      <li><strong>Screenshots</strong> work best for visual conventions (e.g., video framing or post formatting).</li>
      <li><strong>Detailed descriptions</strong> work best when neither quotes nor screenshots capture the feature (e.g., music use or ordering of information).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Writing Introductions &amp; Conclusions</h3>
