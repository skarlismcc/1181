    <h1>Final Portfolio</h1>

        <p>For your final portfolio, you will be asked to revise your genre analysis essay one final time, write a list-article on your thoughts on AI &amp; writing, and finally, write/create a reflection on the class and you as a writer.</p>
    <p>Revision is all about taking a fresh set of eyes to previously created materials. Although this may sound like glorified proofreading, revision is a whole heap more than that, and to be done effectively, revision requires the power triad of time, organization, and attention to detail. The danger with revision lies in the temptation to believe you already know all the ins and outs of your work, believing there is nothing left to “do” to it.</p>
    <p>Editing is the final step as part of the revision, but revision is not editing. Revision is revisiting, rereading, rethinking, reworking, re-seeing.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>is worth <strong>30%</strong> of your total grade,</li>
          <li>is due in Canvas by the <strong>START of class</strong> on the due date,</li>
          <li><strong>will not</strong> be accepted late, and</li>
          <li>must be <strong>checked in</strong> to ensure that I can access/view all parts of your portfolio.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Class attendance on the due date is mandatory unless you check in your portfolio with me in advance. See “Submitting Your Final Portfolio” below for more information.</li>
      <li>Check the <a href="/calendar/index.html">Class Calendar</a> for the due date.</li>
    </ul>
  

    <h2 id="submitting">Submitting Your Final Portfolio</h2>
    <p>On the Final Portfolio due date, you will briefly meet with me in the classroom, and I will check that I can access all parts of your portfolio. This will ensure that documents were uploaded correctly, links or videos work (if applicable), etc. Since this is due at the end of the semester, everything must be submitted on time and correctly. By meeting and checking in your portfolio, we can ensure there aren’t any submission mistakes that lead to a failing grade.</p>

    <h3>To Submit your Final Portfolio</h3>

    <h4>Before the Final Portfolio class period:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Submit your <strong>Final Genre Analysis Essay</strong> to the Final Genre Analysis Essay assignment in Canvas.</li>
      <li>Submit your <strong>AI &amp; Writing Listicle</strong> to the AI &amp; Writing Listicle assignment in Canvas.</li>
      <li>Submit your <strong>Class Reflection</strong> to the Class Reflection assignment in Canvas.</li>
      <li>Double-check that all parts have submitted correctly.</li>
      <li>Submit any extra credit you have completed by the due date.</li>
      <li>Plan to bring your laptop/tablet and charger to class.
        <ul>
          <li>If there are any submission problems, you will have a few minutes during the class period to resolve the issue.</li>
          <li>Have all parts of your portfolio on the device you bring or backed up on a cloud drive (Google Drive, OneNote, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If you do not have a laptop/tablet, make sure all parts of your portfolio are backed up somewhere you can access on a borrowed computer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>On the Final Portfolio due date:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Attend class and show up on time.</li>
      <li>During class, I will:
        <ul>
          <li>Check that I can access all parts of your Final Portfolio.</li>
          <li>Check that I’ve received any extra credit you’ve submitted.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If there is a problem with your submission, you will have a few minutes in class to resolve the issue on your own device (if you need to borrow one, let me know).</li>
      <li>To submit the Final Portfolio early, it still must be checked in with me. Plan to check in during office hours or a previous class period. <em>Portfolios cannot be checked in over email.</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Important Note</h3>
    <p>If you fail to attend class on the due date (or check it in early) and any part of your portfolio is not viewable/accessible to me, you will not receive credit for that portion of the portfolio.</p>
    <p>Your portfolio must be submitted on time; late portfolios will not be accepted. Additionally, the portfolio cannot be resubmitted in any part once I’ve finished grading it. Since it’s the last week of class, I need to get these graded quickly so that I can submit your final grades.</p>
    <p>In other words, it’s essential that you submit all parts of your portfolio on time and correctly.</p>
