    <h1>Tech-free Writing Sessions &amp; Journal</h1>

    <p>Tech-free Writing (TFW) sessions are class time dedicated to writing skills, idea development, drafting, and revision <em>without</em> technology. We’ll also write with technology in this course, but these sessions help us slow down and think more deeply, so we’ll reserve time for that in class.</p>

    <p>For TFW sessions, you’ll receive a notebook/journal to use. At the end of each TFW session, the journal is turned in and I will hold it from week to week.</p>

    <p>See the <a href="/calendar/index.html">Calendar</a> for which class meetings include a TFW session.</p>

    <h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>

    <p>You’ll be graded on thoughtful, consistent participation across all TFW days. Final evaluation happens after the last TFW day of the semester (around Week 14).</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>A:</strong> Missed no more than one TFW session*. Participated fully; writing shows thoughtful engagement and effort.</li>
      <li><strong>B:</strong> Missed two or more sessions*. Participated fully; writing shows thoughtful engagement and effort.</li>
      <li><strong>C:</strong> Missed two or more sessions*. Mostly participated; writing does not always show thoughtful engagement and effort.</li>
      <li><strong>D:</strong> Frequently absent, left early, or arrived late. Participation and effort were inconsistent.</li>
      <li><strong>E:</strong> Frequently absent, left early, and/or arrived late. Participation was minimal; writing shows little effort or engagement with the session’s focus.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><em>* One TFW session can be missed to account for illness/life/etc. One additional TFW session can be made up in class on the TFW Make-up Day (see the calendar for the date).</em></p>
