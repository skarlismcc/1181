    <h1>Individual Conferences</h1>

    <h2>Overview & Purpose</h2>
    <p>As part of Project 1, we will hold individual conferences. These meetings are a dedicated time for us to sit down and chat about your paper one-on-one. Rather than receiving written comments on a rubric, this conversation is how you will receive feedback on your work.</p>
    
    <p>During our time together, we will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Discuss the strengths of your paper and identifying areas for growth.</li>
      <li>Go over specific revision suggestions to help you prepare for the Final Portfolio.</li>
      <li>Answer any questions you have about your paper, your writing process, or the class in general.</li>
      <li>Input your Project 1 grade into Canvas together.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
      <h2>Important: Mandatory Attendance</h2>
      <p>Because this conference is the primary method for delivering feedback and grading your Project 1 assignment, attendance is mandatory. Please prioritize this meeting as you would a regular class session.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>How to Prepare</h2>
    <p>To ensure our conversation is productive, please follow these steps before your scheduled slot:</p>

        <h3>1. Sign Up for a Time Slot</h3>
    <p>Instructions for signing up for a conference time will be coming soon!</p>
    
    <h3>2. Submit Your Revised Draft</h3>
    <p>It is essential that you complete and submit your <a href="/assignments/revised-draft.html">Revised Draft</a> before your conference begins. I need to see your work to give you helpful feedback!</p>

    <h3>3. Arrive on Time</h3>
    <p>Our conference slots are scheduled back-to-back. Please arrive on time (or log in on time) so we can make the most of our allotted minutes. If you are late, we will only have the remaining time in your slot to talk.</p>

    <div class="tips-accent-box">
      <h3>Tip: Record the Conversation</h3>
      <p>I strongly recommend recording our conversation on your phone or laptop. We will cover a lot of ground in a short time, and having a recording allows you to listen back later when you are working on your Final Portfolio revisions. This way, you don't have to worry about frantically taking notes while we talk.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Scheduling & Logistics</h2>
    
    <h3>Sign-Up</h3>
    <p>You will sign up for a conference slot ahead of time (instructions coming soon). </p>

    <h3>Format (In-Person or Zoom)</h3>
    <p>Most conferences will be held in person, but there will be specific time slots available for Zoom if you prefer a virtual meeting. Please check the sign-up sheet for location details.</p>

    <h3>Rescheduling Policy</h3>
    <p>I understand that life happens. If you miss your conference due to illness or an emergency, it is <strong>your responsibility</strong> to contact me and reschedule during my available office hours within the following few weeks.</p>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>Participation in the individual conference accounts for half of your self-evalulation and reflection grade, which accounts for 20% of your Project 1 grade.</p>
