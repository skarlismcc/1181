    <h2 id="instructions">Peer Review Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Leave feedback on the paper using Canvas (see instructions below).</li>
      <li>Leave <strong>at least one</strong> comment that:
        <ul>
          <li>addresses a <strong>high- or middle-order concern</strong> that could use improvement (organization, details, paragraph structure, examples, flow, transitions, etc.).</li>
          <li>points to a <strong>specific spot</strong> in the paper that illustrates the issue.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Leave <strong>at least one</strong> comment about something that’s working well (ideally connected to a high-/middle-order concern).</li>
      <li><strong>Do not</strong> leave later-order concerns (grammar/spelling/mechanics) unless they block readability. If so, make <strong>one</strong> note to explain the issue.</li>
      <li><strong>Do not edit</strong> your classmate’s draft (no direct grammar fixing in the text).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="additional">Additional Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Focus on ideas that could <strong>improve the paper</strong>. You don’t have to prescribe exact fixes.</li>
      <li>It’s fine to comment as a <strong>reader</strong>—describe what you notice rather than trying to “be the editor.”</li>
      <li>Use <strong>feedback sandwiches</strong> when possible (from the “In-Class Peer Review” reading).</li>
      <li>Leave <strong>only</strong> high- and middle-order concern feedback.
        <ul>
          <li>No grammar/spelling feedback.</li>
          <li><em>Exception:</em> For a consistent issue (e.g., fragments/run-ons) that hurts readability or flow, you can mark it <strong>once</strong> to flag the trend.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>For in-person classes: you may discuss papers verbally, but make sure feedback is also left on the draft in Canvas.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="hoc-moc">High- and Middle-Order Concerns</h2>

    <h3>High-Order Concerns: The Big Stuff</h3>
    <p>Think about assignment requirements, overall organization, audience, purpose, and genre.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Does the paper meet the assignment prompts and use evidence from genre samples?</li>
      <li>Is it written as an academic analysis essay for an appropriate audience?</li>
      <li>Do ideas appear in a logical order, and does the paper stay on topic?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Leave feedback on any area that could be improved.</p>

    <h3>Middle-Order Concerns: The Effective Writing Stuff</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Are paragraphs well-developed (e.g., Topic-Evidence-Discussion)? Are claims supported with quotes, descriptions, or screenshots from genre samples?</li>
      <li>Are there transitions connecting ideas? Does the draft feel choppy or disconnected?</li>
      <li>Any sentences that are too long, awkward, or hard to read?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Leave feedback on any area that could be improved.</p>
