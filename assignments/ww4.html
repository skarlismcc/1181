    <h1>Weekly Writing 4: Analysis of a Communication Event</h1>

    <p>For this week, choose one communication event (a post, video, written comment, etc.) from your community and answer the questions below. This is <em>not</em> an essay assignment—answers can be listed.</p>

<h2>Reqirements</h2>
<p> <b>Length:</b> Varies<br/>
    <b>Genres:</b> Link or Screenshot; Responses to Questions<br/>
   </p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Pick one message/communication from your community. This could be a video post, a written post, a comment/reply, or something similar.</li>
      <li>Link to the post (public communities only) <strong>or</strong> include a screenshot. Double-check that the link works. To link, just paste the URL from your browser into your document.</li>
      <li>For screenshots, blur or black out all identifying information (usernames, names, photos).
        <ul>
          <li>This is especially important for closed/private communities (e.g., Discord servers, private Facebook groups).</li>
          <li>Check the group’s rules about screenshots. If screenshots aren’t allowed, either ask permission or copy/paste the text from the post or comment.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Paste the screenshot or link into your Weekly Writing 4 document.</li>
      <li>Answer the following questions below your screenshot/link. (List format is fine.)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Questions to Answer</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What community is this from? (e.g., “This linked video from the BookTok community.”)</li>
      <li>What is the message/post about?</li>
      <li>What do you think the purpose of this message/post is?</li>
      <li>Who do you think the primary audience is? What about the post makes you think that?</li>
      <li>Is this post/message a typical type of communication in your community?</li>
      <li>Does the post/message use any language that is (or might be) specific to this community? If so, what?</li>
      <li>Did others interact with the post/message? If so, how many, and how did they interact? <em>(For example: “493 people liked this post; 283 commented.”)</em></li>
    </ul>
