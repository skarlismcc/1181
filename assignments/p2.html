    <h1>Genre Remix</h1>

    <p>For Project 2, you will remix your Genre Analysis Essay from Project 1 into a new genre and present your remix, along with some additional information, on a poster board.</p>

    <pProject 2 has two parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href = "/assignments/p2-remix.html">Genre Remix</a></li>
      <li><a href = "/assignments/p2-poster.html">Poster Presentation</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Remix Requirements</h2>

    <h3>Content: The remix should...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Include the major information from your Project 1 genre analysis essay, such as information about the genre and some of the common conventions</li>
      <li>It does not need to include everything from your genre analysis essay (for example, it may not need to include information about the community if the audience of your remix is people in your community).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Writing: The remix should...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Be written in the tone and style of the new genre.</li>
      <li>Think about formality, style, grammar, etc. (For example, a blog article might have a more conversational tone and speak directly to the reader, whereas a news article would not).</li>
      <li>Demonstrate expected conventions of the new genre.</li>
      <li>Think about paragraphing (and paragraph length), titles,  headers, style, order of information, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, a news article would be expected to have a large title that would grab readers attention, the date, a byline (i.e. the author's name, typically right before the date), etc.</p>

    <h3>Design: The remix should...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Follow the design conventions of the new genre.</li>
      <li>Think about page layout, columns, font size (for titles, headers, and paragraph text), color, photos/imagery, and any other design elements that tend to be present in that genre.</li>
      <li>Be polished and well designed.</li>
      <li>This should look like a professional version (or publishable version) the new genre.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Poster Presentation Requirements</h2>
    <p>Your original paper and your remix will be displayed on a tri-fold poster on our poster presentation day (see the Calendar for the date and location).</p>

    <h3>The poster presentation requirements are as follows:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Be presented on a tri-fold poster board (36&quot;x48&quot;, or close to it so that everything can fit; any color is fine; must be able to stand up on its own [i.e. no regular flat posters that require being taped on the wall])</li>
      <li>The tri-fold poster board must include the following (printed out and glued/taped to the poster board):</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Revised draft of your genre analysis essay that was submitted for Project 1</li>
      <li>Remix</li>
      <li>Information about the new audience, purpose, and genre</li>
      <li>The name of your community (I recommend putting this as the title at the top of your poster board)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The poster board should also demonstrate design principles.</p>
    <p>This overall poster should look professional and design choices should support readability, clarity of information, and the "vibe"/aesthetic of your community.</p>
    <p>Nothing should be handwritten (possible exception is the title of the whole poster if you are good at artistic lettering; otherwise, plan to print everything out).</p>

    <h4>Optional:</h4>
    <p>Anything else you think would help people understand the community or remix project, such as background information.</p>

    <h2>Additional Guidelines &amp; Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Size and Format:</strong> Use a tri-fold poster board to create this display. (It will need to stand on its own, so a normal poster board will not work).</li>
      <li><strong>Length:</strong> The Genre Remix should be roughly the expected length of the new genre. Also make sure to choose a genre that allows you to get into enough details to truly remix the ideas from Project 1 (i.e. a short infographic or short news article won't be enough).</li>
      <li><strong>Software:</strong> You may use PowerPoint, Canva, Adobe Illustrator, or any design software you are comfortable with to create your remix.</li>
      <li><strong>Citations:</strong> Include any necessary citation/referencess for images or sources used.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the remix, include references or citations if/when they are appropriate (i.e. they will likely not be in MLA style for any remix, but certain genres, like news articles have a particular way of explaining where they got the information.</p>
    <p>For the poster, if you include any images that require attribution, just include the attributions in small print below the image used (not all images require attribution. For example, memes would not include attribution. Check the licensing on anything you use when available.).</p>
    <p><strong>AI Statement of Use:</strong> Include a small AI Statement of Use at the bottom of your poster (I recommend to the far left or far right bottom). If no AI was used, please include that information. Otherwise, just briefly explain how and where it was used.</p>

    <h2>Grading</h2>

    <h3>Grading Criteria</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Content:</strong> Does the Genre Remix clearly connect to the information from your Genre Analysis Essay? Does Genre Remix clearly demonstrate the new genre and audience and a purpose?</li>
      <li><strong>Genre conventions (written):</strong> Does the Genre Remix demonstrate the expected conventions of the new genre? i.e. does is sound like a magazine article? (or whatever genre was chosen)</li>
      <li><strong>Genre conventions (visual):</strong> Does the remix include visual design/elements? Does that design effectively demonstrate the expected conventions of the new genre? i.e. Does it look like a magazine article? (or whatever genre was chosen)</li>
      <li><strong>Design Principles:</strong> Are design principles such as contrast, balance, typography, shape, line, and hierarchy applied in a way that promotes readability and supports the content of the poster?</li>
      <li><strong>Poster Design:</strong> Is the poster layout clear and easy to follow? Does the design of the poster fit the topic/genre/community? (for example: do the font and color choices fit the topic?)</li>
      <li><strong>Requirements &amp; Guidelines:</strong> all other assignment requirements and guidelines (from above sections) are followed and met.</li>
    </ul>
