    <h1>Project 1 — Genre Analysis Essay Revised Draft</h1>

    <p>Your draft must be effectively revised after you receive feedback from Peer Review (or the ACS tutor). This revision should primarily focus on <strong>high and middle order concerns</strong>, such as organization, flow, transitions, use of evidence, and paragraph development. While proofreading (i.e., fixing typos and mechanics) is appreciated, that alone will not fulfill the revision requirement.</p>
    
    <p>The revised draft must also meet all other requirements for the paper, which are listed on this assignment sheet, such as word count requirements, citations, formatting, using evidence, and covering the required topics.</p>
