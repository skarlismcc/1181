    <h1>Poster Presentation</h1>
    <p>Your original revised draft (from Project 1), your new remix, and some additional information will be displayed on a tri-fold poster on our poster presentation day (see the <a href="/calendar/index.html"> Calendar </a> for the date and location).</p>

    <h3>Poster Presentation Requirements:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Tri-fold poster board (36&quot;x48&quot;, or close to it so that everything can fit; any color is fine; must be able to stand up on its own [i.e. no regular flat posters that require being taped on the wall])</li>
      <li>The tri-fold poster board must include the following (printed out and glued/taped to the poster board):</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>Revised draft of your genre analysis essay that was submitted for Project 1</li>
      <li>Remix</li>
      <li>Information about the remix audience, remix purpose, and remix genre</li>
      <li>The name of your community (I recommend putting this as the title at the top of your poster board)</li>
      <li> Optional: Background information, additional design elements (like graphics or design elements), or other useful information can also be included on the poster.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The poster board should also demonstrate design principles.</p>
    <p>This overall poster should look professional and design choices should support readability, clarity of information, and the "vibe"/aesthetic of your community.</p>
    <p>Nothing should be handwritten (possible exception is the title of the whole poster if you are good at artistic lettering; otherwise, plan to print everything out).</p>

    <h4>Optional:</h4>
    <p>Anything else you think would help people understand the community or remix project, such as background information.</p>

    <h2>Additional Guidelines &amp; Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Size and Format:</strong> Use a tri-fold poster board to create this display. (It will need to stand on its own, so a normal poster board will not work).</li>
      <li><strong>Software:</strong> You may use PowerPoint, Canva, Adobe Illustrator, or any design software you are comfortable with to create your remix and design your poster elements.</li>
    <p>For the poster, if you include any images that require attribution, just include the attributions in small print below the image used (not all images require attribution. For example, memes would not include attribution. Check the licensing on anything you use when available.).</p>
    <p><strong>AI Statement of Use:</strong> Include a small AI Statement of Use at the bottom of your poster (I recommend to the far left or far right bottom). If no AI was used, please include that information. Otherwise, just briefly explain how and where it was used.</p>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>
    <h3>I don't have a printer; what should I do?</h3>
    <p>The library at Macomb has both black &amp; white and color printers, which you can use for a small per page fee. Talk to someone at the library for help using the printers.</p>
    <p>Note: DO NOT wait until the last minute to print things out. There are many things that could go wrong at the last minute, and this project cannot be submitted late since you are presenting these in-person.</p>

    <h3>I'm really sick or had an emergency on the poster presentation day; what do I do?</h3>
    <p>While this is a required presentation, I understand that things happen. If you have an emergency (or major illness) on the day of the presentation, please contact me when you can and we can discuss options for an alternative to the presentation portion of the assignment. Please only use this option in an actual emergency and plan on being on time and present.</p>
