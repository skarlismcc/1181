    <h1>Weekly Writing 1: Brainstorming</h1>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p><b>Length:</b> At least 300 words<br/>
       <b>Genre:</b> Short Essay
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>For this first Weekly Writing assignment, write a short essay exploring your interests and the online communities in which you currently participate or have an interest.</p>
    <P>Use the following prompts to explore your existing discourse communities in a short essay:</P>
    <Ul>
      <li>
        <div class="list-para">
          What are your hobbies? Do you participate in any online communities around your hobbies? What other online communities do you belong to or participate in? How do you participate in these communities (for example, creating content, commenting on posts, watching content, etc.)?
        </div>
      </li>
    </Ul>
    <p><em>Note:</em> Do not list the prompts and reply to each one individually; use them as a starting point to explore ideas in paragraph form.</p>

    <h2>Examples of Online Communities</h2>
    <p>Here are a few examples of online discourse communities: a Discord server for a particular game, a TikTok community (e.g., GamerTok, BookTok, FashionTok), a Facebook group for knitters, a subreddit, a Twitter/X community (e.g., BlackTwitter, ScienceTwitter), or an Instagram community (e.g., Dogs of Instagram). This list isn’t exhaustive—it’s meant to get you started.</p>

    <h2>Reminders for Weekly Writings</h2>
<p>As a reminder, please...</p>
<ul><li>Write in your own voice and style for these assignments.</li>
<li>Don't worry about grammar and typos.</li>
