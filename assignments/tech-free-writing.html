<h1>Tech-free Writing</h1>
<p>
    Tech-free Writing (TFW) sessions are dedicated times during class to work on writing skills, developing ideas, drafting, and revisions without the distraction of technology. While we will do plenty of digital writing in this class, it is important to learn how to slow down and think deeply, so we will dedicate specific time to this practice.
</p>

<h2>Tech-free 10s (TF10s)</h2>
<p>
    The first 10 minutes of most classes will be a tech-free freewriting session. <strong>Freewriting</strong> is an activity where you write for a set amount of time rather than a set length or specific goal. It can be used to brainstorm, work through ideas, or get "unstuck" on a writing project.</p>
    <p>For our Tech-free 10s (TF10s), the focus is on building the habit of writing freely and helping you get thoughts from your brain to the page.
</p>

<h3>What do I write about?</h3>
<p>
    Anything. Rant about your job, write about what you need to get done this week, describe your dream vacation, write about a movie you just saw, vent about your other classes, or simply write "I don't know what to write" until a new thought appears.</p>
    <p>The topic doesn't matter; keeping the pen moving does.</p>
</p>

<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<p>
    There are no rules for TF10s except to <strong>keep writing</strong>. Keep your pen on the paper until the time is up.
</p>

<h2>Additional Tech-free Writing Sessions</h2>
<p>
    At other points in the semester, we may pull out the TFW journals to brainstorm or work on specific writing tasks. These sessions will have clear goals and topics.
</p>

<h2>Tech-free Journals</h2>
<p>
    For tech-free writing, you will be provided a journal to use. You will return the journal to me at the end of the TFW session, and I will hold on to them from week to week.
</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>
    You will receive credit for being present and writing for the entire TFW session. Since these are done in-person, you can miss up to four TFW sessions with no penalty.
</p>

  <h2>How to Earn Full Credit</h2>
  <p>
    The goal of these sessions is to build writing stamina and clear your mind. 
    Earning credit is simple—just fully engage with the process for the 10-minute duration:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Be Present:</strong> Be present and writing for the full session. Arriving on time helps maintain the quiet, focused atmosphere for everyone.</li>
    <li><strong>Go Analog:</strong> Give your brain a true break by keeping phones, earbuds, and laptops stowed away.</li>
    <li><strong>Keep Moving:</strong> The only requirement is that you keep writing. If you get stuck, simply write about being stuck—the physical act of writing is what counts.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    Because life happens, you have a "buffer" of 4 sessions that you can miss without penalty. 
    <em>Note: For grading purposes, a session counts as "missed" if you are absent/tardy and miss the session <strong>or</strong> if you are present but did not participate fully (i.e. not writing for most or all of the time allocated).</em>
