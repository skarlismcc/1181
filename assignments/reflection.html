    <h1>Self-Evaluation and Reflection Form</h1>

    <h2>Assignment Overview</h2>
    <p>For this project, you will also complete a reflection and self-evaluation form to reflect on your writing process and evaluate your work. Complete this assignment once you have completed your revised draft.</p>

    <div class="callout">
      <h2>Purpose & Strategy</h2>
      <p>This form serves two important purposes: it helps you reflect on your writing process, and it acts as a final check to ensure you haven't forgotten any of the requirements for the assignment.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> I recommend completing this form <em>after</em> you are ready to submit your revised draft. As you fill it out, carefully reread the assignment sheet and the requirements listed on the form to ensure you didn't miss anything.</p>
      
      <p>If you realize you missed a requirement while filling out this form, you can still fix the issue and resubmit your revised draft. I will accept resubmissions up until the point that I give you feedback and grade the assignment.</p>
      
      <p>We will also go over some of your reflection and thoughts during our <a href="/assignments/conferences.html">individual conferences</a> when I give you feedback.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Requirements & Submission</h2>
    <p>The specific requirements for the self-evaluation and reflection are located directly on the form.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Submission:</strong> Complete this form on Canvas. (The form is set up as a "quiz" so that you can fill it out directly in Canvas.)</p>

    <h2>Grading</h2>
    <p>The Self-evaluation & Reflection assignment is graded on a pass/fail scale. This grade includes your individual conference and accounts for 20% of your Project 1 grade, overall. The grade is based on the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Completing the Self Eval & Reflection Form</li>
            <li>Meeting any word requirements/requirements for the prompts on the form</li>
            <li>Attending and participating in your individual conferences for your revised draft</li>
        </ul></p>
