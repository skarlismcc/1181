    <h1>Weekly Writing 3: How Your Community Communicates</h1>

    <p>This week’s weekly writing has two parts. You can submit both parts in the same Word document (or paste into the same text entry field).</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p> <b>Length:</b> Part 1: 150-300 words; Part 2: At least 200 words<br/>
    <b>Genres:</b> Reading Response & Short Essay<br/>
   </p>

    <h3>Part I: Reading Response</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Read: <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/writingaboutwriting/3-reading-and-writing/3-3-navigating-genres" rel="noopener" target="_blank">3.3 Navigating Genres</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Write a 150–300 word response to the prompt:
        <ul>
          <li>Based on the reading, how might learning about genre help you become a better writer?</li>
          <li>Connect the idea of genre (as explained in the reading) to writing in college, assignments you currently have or have had in the past, or workplace writing.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="list-para">
          For example, what is a genre you had to write for a class (like a lab report or argumentative essay)? How did you figure out how to write in that genre and what the expectations were?
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        Be specific. Use points from the text and specific examples from your own coursework or work experience (avoid purely hypothetical examples).
        <div class="list-para">
          ✔ Specific: “In my history class last semester, I had to write…”<br/>
          ✖ Hypothetical: “In a history class, a student might be asked to…”
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Part II: Short Essay</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Spend time this week in the discourse community you chose in Weekly Writing 2. Pay attention to how people interact and whether there are different types of communication (e.g., a post vs. a reply vs. an emoji reaction).
      </li>
      <li>
        Write a 200-word minimum short essay about communication in your discourse community. Consider:
        <ul>
          <li>How do people in your community communicate? What types of interactions occur? What topics tend to be discussed? Do you notice trends (e.g., areas of agreement or recurring debates)? Is there specific slang or acronyms?</li>
          <li>What genres are you noticing in your community? (Use the reading to help identify genres.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Additional Instructions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use paragraphs to organize your ideas—aim for one main idea per paragraph.</li>
      <li>Mention your community near the beginning of your short essay to help with context. For example: “In my discourse community, BookTok, I’ve noticed…”</li>
    </ul>
