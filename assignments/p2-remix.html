    <h1>Genre Remix</h1>

    <p>For Project 2, you will remix your Genre Analysis Essay from Project 1 into a new genre. The new genre should have a clear audience and purpose.</p>

    <p>Your new genre must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>include writing (i.e. it cannot be a visual-only genre),</li>
      <li>include a design or visual element,</li>
      <li>be written to a clear and logical audience,</li>
      <li>be written for a clear and logical purpose,</li>
      <li>have a different audience than your initial paper, and</li>
      <li>be printable and able to be displayed on a tri-fold poster (i.e. no videos).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Possible Genres</h2>
    <p>Let's say that your Genre Analysis paper was on GymTok tutorial videos (for example: videos on TikTok showing people how to lift weights).</p>
    <p>Some possible genres, depending on your paper choice, audience, and purpose:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Quick Reference Guide on how to create effective GymTok instructional videos</li>
      <li>Newspaper or magazine article</li>
      <li>Online article*</li>
      <li>Infographic on how to create effective GymTok instructional videos</li>
      <li>wikihow webpage*</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This list of example genres is not exhaustive. If you are unsure if a genre will work, please ask! Just make sure that it allows for you to remix the information from your Genre Analysis Essay, can be printed out and displayed on a tri-fold poster, and includes design elements.</p>
    <p>* Note: you will not be creating these online, but instead creating a printable document that is designed and written like this genre.</p>

    <h2>Example Remix</h2>
    <p>As an example of what this might look like, we'll stick with GymTok as the example community and instructional videos as the specific genre from Project 1.</p>

    <h3>Original Paper:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Genre:</strong> academic analysis essay</li>
      <li><strong>Audience:</strong> Your professor (primary audience) and classmates (secondary audience)</li>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To inform your reader about your chosen genre and analyze the genre</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example Remix:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Genre:</strong> Fitness magazine article</li>
      <li><strong>Audience:</strong> General adult audience who reads this fitness magazine</li>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To inform the reader about the benefits and possible drawbacks of GymTok instructional videos.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Additional info: This remix would include information about the genre and typically what is expected in the genre (i.e. conventions, but consider your audience and what word choices would actually be used in this case). Additionally, since this is an article for a fitness magazine, the article would have some point that it's making about these GymTok videos, like whether they are helpful or how they are changing how people learn fitness, etc.</p>

    <h2>Remix Requirements</h2>

    <h3>Content: The remix should...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Include the major information from your Project 1 genre analysis essay, such as information about the genre and some of the common conventions</li>
      <li>It does not need to include everything from your genre analysis essay (for example, it may not need to include information about the community if the audience of your remix is people in your community).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Writing: The remix should...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Be written in the tone and style of the new genre.</li>
      <li>Think about formality, style, grammar, etc. (For example, a blog article might have a more conversational tone and speak directly to the reader, whereas a news article would not).</li>
      <li>Demonstrate expected conventions of the new genre.</li>
      <li>Think about paragraphing (and paragraph length), titles,  headers, style, order of information, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, a news article would be expected to have a large title that would grab readers attention, the date, a byline (i.e. the author's name, typically right before the date), etc.</p>

    <h3>Design: The remix should...</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Follow the design conventions of the new genre.</li>
      <li>Think about page layout, columns, font size (for titles, headers, and paragraph text), color, photos/imagery, and any other design elements that tend to be present in that genre.</li>
      <li>Be polished and well designed.</li>
      <li>This should look like a professional version (or publishable version) the new genre.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQs</h2>

    <h3>Can I reuse information from Project 1 for this?</h3>
    <p>Yes! Project 2 should use the information from your Genre Analysis Essay as a starting place for the remix.</p>

    <h3>Can I add something to my remix that wasn’t in my Project 1?</h3>
    <p>Also yes! Depending on your new genre, you may need to add additional information.</p>
