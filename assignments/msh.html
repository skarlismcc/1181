    <h1>Macomb Scavenger Hunt</h1>

    <p>Your mission for the Macomb Scavenger Hunt is to find student resources across campus that will help you succeed in this class and as a student at Macomb.</p>

    <h2>What you’ll need</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A phone with a camera (or a digital camera)</li>
      <li>Time to walk around campus — you can work together, but each student must take and submit their own photos</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Part I: Photographs</h2>
    <p>Take a photograph of yourself in front of the door/signage (make sure the room number or signage is visible) for each of the following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Academic Success Center — Reading &amp; Writing Tutoring</li>
      <li>Academic Success Center — Subject Area Tutoring Area
        <div class="list-para">This ASC Subject Tutoring area might not have a sign; take a photo that clearly shows the area.</div>
      </li>
      <li>Career Services</li>
      <li>Student Life and Leadership office</li>
      <li>Another student service of your choice (e.g., Veteran Services, Counseling and Advising, etc.)</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Exterior signage (e.g., outdoor wayfinding signs) will not count. The goal is to go inside and either talk with staff about what they do or pick up a flyer/info about the service.</p>
    <p>Occasionally, buildings may be under construction and spaces move temporarily. If that is the case, go to the temporary location.</p>

    <p>Once you have all five photos, insert them into a Word document.</p>
    
    <h2>Part II: Explanation of the Resource</h2>
    <p>Under each photo, write a brief explanation describing the resource and what services they provide.</p>

    <h2>Submission Checklist</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All 5 required photos (see list above)</li>
      <li>A brief explanation for each resource, placed under each photo</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Each student must turn in their own project. Even if you took group photos together, submit your own copies and write your own explanations.</p>
