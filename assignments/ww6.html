        Chapter 6.2: Understanding Visual Rhetoric
      </a>
    </p>

    <h3>Write</h3>
    <p><b>Part 1 (short paragraph):</b> Based on the reading, how does visual design affect how we read texts and engage with genres? Be specific and support your answer with examples from the reading.</p>

    <p><b>Part 2:</b></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose one visual design element discussed in the reading (e.g., line, shape, color, etc.).</li>
      <li>Find a specific communication event from your community that uses this visual element. (See the reminder/definition below.)</li>
      <li>Explain how this one visual element functions in your example.
        <div class="list-para">
          For example: How is this visual element used? How does it impact the post?
        </div>
        <div class="list-para">
          Somewhere in your writing, clearly identify your community. For example: “This meme is from my discourse community, BookTok…”
        </div>
        <div class="list-para">
          If the post is from a public platform, include a link at the end of your essay. If it comes from a private space, attach a screenshot of the full post, making sure to blur any names or personal information.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Reminder: What counts as a “communication event”?</h3>
    <p>For our class, a communication event is a piece of writing, image, or video that is posted in your community. It could be any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A written post</li>
      <li>A written comment or series of comments</li>
      <li>A video post (include the caption, if any)</li>
      <li>An image post (include the caption)</li>
      <li>A series of Discord or chat messages</li>
      <li>A reply on a forum</li>
      <li>And so on…</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If your community’s communication events are all text-only, you may describe something about the site’s visuals instead (e.g., a Facebook group banner, a subreddit’s color choices, etc.).</p>
