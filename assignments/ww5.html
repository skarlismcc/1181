    <h1>Weekly Writing 5: Analyzing Genre</h1>

    <p>Similar to last week, choose one communication event (a post, video, written comment, etc.) from your community and answer the questions below. This is <em>not</em> an essay assignment—answers can be listed.</p>

<h2>Reqirements</h2>
<p> <b>Length:</b> Varies<br/>
    <b>Genres:</b> Link or Screenshot; Responses to Questions<br/>
   </p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Pick one message/communication from your community. This could be a video post, a written post, a comment/reply, or something similar.</li>
      <li>Public Communities Only:
        <ul>
          <li><i>For example, TikTok, Instagram, Reddit, etc.</i></li>
          <li>Link to the post by copying and pasting the link into your Weekly Writing 5 document.</li>
          <li>Double-check that the link works. </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
      <li>Closed/Private Communities Only:
        <ul>
          <li><i>For example, Discord servers, private Facebook groups, etc.</i></li>
          <li>Take a screenshot of the post and copy/paste it into your Weekly Writing 5 document.</li>
          <li>Then blur or black out all identifying information (usernames, names, photos). </li>
          <li>Check the group’s rules about screenshots. If screenshots aren’t allowed, either ask permission or copy/paste the text from the post or comment.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Answer the questions below your screenshot/link. (List format is fine; you do not need to write this as an essay.)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Questions to Answer</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>What community is this from?</li>
      <li>What is the genre of your communication event?
        <div class="list-para">For example: TikTok video, YouTube video, Discord message, Reddit post, etc.</div>
      </li>
      <li>If you needed to get more specific, what would you call it?
        <div class="list-para">For example: GymTok instructional video, tutorial video, review video, game-review post, POV video, “Getting Ready With Me” video, etc. If your genre is something like a comments section or general Discord chat, you might not be able to get more specific—just note that.</div>
      </li>
      <li>What do you notice about how this post/message is written or created? Focus on rhetorical moves rather than content.
        <div class="list-para">Possible things to consider: camera angles/positioning, music (is there music? what kind?), color choices, casual vs. formal tone, text formatting, captions, images, emoji use, organization of information, etc.</div>
      </li>
      <li>Are the features you noticed above common in this type of post/message in your community? Are most communications like this, or different? In what ways?</li>
    </ul>
