    <h1>AI &amp; Writing Listicle</h1>
        <p>Over the semester, we’ve looked at how AI can both support and complicate the writing process. For your final assignment, you’ll create a listicle-style reflection that captures what you’ve learned, what you’re still wondering about, and where you stand on Generative AI use with writing.</p>

    <h2 id="assignment">AI &amp; Writing Listicle Overview</h2>
    <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Listicle (more info below)<br>
       <strong>Length:</strong> 300 words minimum (for the whole listicle)</p>

    <h3 id="what-is-listicle">What is a listicle?</h3>
    <p>A listicle is a short article written as a list. Think: Buzzfeed-style pieces (e.g., “7 Ways to Unwind”). Each item has a brief heading, followed by a few sentences of explanation or reflection. It’s a clear, informal way to organize ideas—something between a list and a blog post.</p>
    <p>An example listicle is included at the bottom of this page.</p>

    <h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
    <p>Create a listicle that shares your personal takeaways, opinions, and lingering questions about AI and writing. Treat it as a reflection on what you learned, what stood out, and what you see as important moving forward. End with your overall thoughts on how you view AI in writing now.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Title Your Listicle</strong><br>
        Start with a creative/descriptive title that reflects your theme. For example:
        <ul>
          <li>5 Things I’ve Learned About AI and Writing</li>
          <li>3 Reasons I’m Wary of AI—and 2 Reasons I’m Curious</li>
          <li>What I Know (and Don’t Know) About Writing in the Age of AI</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Write Clear List Item Headers</strong><br>
        Give each list item a short, clear header that captures the main idea (e.g., “AI Helps Me Brainstorm,” “Still Not Sure About Ethics”).</li>
      <li><strong>Reflect on Each Point</strong><br>
        Under each header, write 3–5 sentences reflecting on that idea. Share thoughts, questions, or experiences; connect to course activities or discussions.</li>
      <li><strong>Final Thoughts</strong><br>
        End with a 4–6 sentence reflection on your overall view of AI and writing after this semester. Consider:
        <ul>
          <li>Do you think you’ll use generative AI in your writing going forward? Why or why not?</li>
          <li>If yes, how will you use it responsibly or effectively?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="include">What To Possibly Include</h2>
    <p>The following are possible topics you could use for your listicle, but you are not limited to these topics.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Things you’ve learned or changed your mind about</li>
      <li>Questions or concerns you still have</li>
      <li>Thoughts on when/if you’ll use AI in your own writing</li>
      <li>Reactions to course activities or discussions</li>
      <li>Ethical, creative, or practical perspectives you’ve developed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Covers the topic thoughtfully</li>
      <li>300 words minimum</li>
      <li>Includes <strong>5–7</strong> list items</li>
      <li>Each list item includes a 3–5 sentence discussion/reflection</li>
      <li>Final thoughts appear below the list</li>
      <li>Listicle is revised and proofread</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="ai-use">AI Use</h2>
    <p>For the AI &amp; Writing Listicle assignment, you may use AI for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Organization</li>
      <li>Revision</li>
      <li>Proofreading</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please do not use AI to generate your ideas—this assignment is a reflection of <em>your</em> thinking. If you use AI for any part of this assignment, include an AI Statement of Use at the end of your document.</p>

    <h2 id="grading-philosophy">Grading Philosophy</h2>
    <p>This is a reflective assignment. I’m looking for honest engagement, thoughtful effort, and a clear attempt to connect what we did in class to your own thinking. A conversational tone—similar to many online list articles—is acceptable.</p>

    <h3>5 Things I’ve Learned About Math in My First Semester</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Math Isn’t Just About Memorizing Formulas</strong><br>
        At first, I thought math was all about memorizing formulas and plugging numbers in. But I quickly learned that understanding the "why" behind each formula is just as important. Once I grasped the concepts behind the equations, the problems started making more sense.</li>
      <li><strong>Practice Really Does Make Perfect</strong><br>
        In the past, I would get frustrated if I didn’t understand something right away. This semester, I realized that the more I practice, the better I get. It’s not about getting things right the first time; it’s about persistence and gradually building up my skills.</li>
      <li><strong>Asking Questions Isn’t a Sign of Weakness</strong><br>
        At the start, I was hesitant to ask questions in class, thinking everyone else understood the material. But I’ve learned that asking questions actually helps me learn better. Whether it’s a simple clarification or a deeper explanation, getting help has made a huge difference in how well I understand the material.</li>
      <li><strong>There’s Often More Than One Way to Solve a Problem</strong><br>
        I used to think there was only one "correct" way to solve a math problem, but I’ve learned there are often multiple methods. Seeing how different approaches lead to the same solution has helped me become more flexible in my thinking and more confident in problem-solving.</li>
      <li><strong>Math Is Everywhere</strong><br>
        At first, I thought math was just about numbers on a page, but I’ve realized it’s all around me. From calculating tips at restaurants to understanding patterns in nature, math is a tool that helps explain the world. This has made the subject feel more relevant and interesting.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong><br>
      (<i>Note: Your final thoughts will be about AI &amp; writing.</i>) Looking ahead, I know that math will continue to challenge me, but I feel more prepared to handle it. I’ll focus on really understanding the concepts, not just memorizing formulas, and keep practicing consistently to improve. I’ll also make sure to ask questions whenever I need clarification and be open to trying different methods for solving problems. Going forward, I want to approach each new topic with patience and curiosity, knowing that persistence is key to mastering the material.</p>
